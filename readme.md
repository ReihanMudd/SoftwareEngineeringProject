# Eats App 🍽️

> **Share. Cook. Eat.**

**Eats App** is a social recipe-sharing platform designed to make cooking accessible and fun. Similar to Pinterest or TikTok, it provides a highly visual interface where food lovers can discover new dishes, share their own culinary creations, and organize their grocery runs—all in one place.

* **🏠 "For You" Page:** A personalized, scrollable feed that recommends recipes based on your past likes and viewing history.
* **📝 Recipe Upload:** A streamlined interface for creators to upload photos, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.
* **🛒 Integrated Shopping List:** Directly add ingredients from a recipe card to a persistent, in-app shopping checklist.
* **⭐ Reviews & Ratings:** A community feedback system allowing users to rate dishes (1-5 stars) and leave detailed comments.
